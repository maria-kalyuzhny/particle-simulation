# Particle System
This project is a physics-based simulation of a particle system using C++, OpenGL, and Imgui. The following forces have been implemented according to an approximation of real physics laws:
* Gravity
* Aerodynamic drag
* Ground plane collisions

## Demo

Changing collision restitution and friction:

## Usage

Left mouse drag: Trackball rotation of environment

Right mouse drag: Zoom in and out

GUI: change all physics & particle properties
